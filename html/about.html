<h2>Hi, welcome to my website!</h2>
<p>
<br />
<br />
My name is Filipe, I work in 3d architectural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Previsualization" rel="external" target="new" title="Wikipedia">*previsualization</a> since 2004. I started in a small architecture office and did freelancing. I also had the previlege of working in large and fast paced environments with tight deadlines like Euro RSCG – Design & Architecture, where I was responsible for delivering 2D/3D images and animations for “Sonae”, “BES”,”Vichy”, “Peugeot” and had the oportunity to work on the rebranding project for “Optimus” in 2008, it was the biggest investment in rebranding ever made at the time in Portugal.
<br />
<br />
In 2007 and 2008 I was invited to prepare and teach 3D Animation workshops in the Portuguese movie festival “Caminhos do cinema Português” and in late 2008 I became an <span title="Autodesk Autorized Training Center">*ATC</span> 3ds Max Instructor at “The edge – Digital Visual Effects Training”.
<br />
<br />
In late 2013 I decided to leave Portugal and move to London to work and improve my skills and my portfolio, but not without first completing high school that was on hold for too long already, I completed a 2 year professional multimedia technician course, where I aquired new skills, mostly in the area of webdesign and interactivity, now I'm ready to move to London... arriving in October.
<br />
<br />
I am passionate about Movies; Photography; CGI; VFX; Music and love teaching, I like keeping up to date about CG software and workflows and to be part of visual projects, from concept to end result.
